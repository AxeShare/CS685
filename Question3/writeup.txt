DEMOGRAPHY
Correlation between following attributes > 0.95 (2 pairs)
Conclusion - 2 pairs out of 153 possible pairs have correlation > 0.95, hence there is not much redundancy.


ECONOMY
Correlation between following attributes > 0.95 (238 pairs)
Conclusion - 238 out of 861 possible pairs have correlation > 0.95. Hence there is significant amount of redundancy.


EDUCATION
Correlation between following attributes > 0.95 (497 pairs)
Conclusion - 497 out of 43956 have correlation > 0.95. Hence there is negligible redundancy.


ACROSS CATEGORIES
Correlation between following attributes > 0.95 (737 pairs)
Conclusion - 737 pairs out of 63546 have correlation > 0.95. Hence there is almost no redundancy.


Another interesting conclusion is that the attributes having correlation > 0.95 across categories is equal to sum of individual categories 
737 = 497 + 238 + 2
This implies that there are no attributes across categories which have correlation > 0.95
